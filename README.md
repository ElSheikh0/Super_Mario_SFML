# Super Mario Remake 

We used :

- C++ in OOP concepts
- SFML for game animations and sound effects.
- Image processing (Tensorflow and openCV) to add additional option of control besides the Keyboard, as you can play with hand gesture.
- Our designs was made with Photoshop and illustrator.

> **Super Mario Bros**. is a platform game. In the game, Mario must race through the *Mushroom Kingdom*.
> 
> Mario jumps, runs, and walks across each level.
> 
> The worlds are full of enemies and platforms, and open holes. If he falls down a hole or misses a jump, he will also lose a *life*.
> 
> Mario has several ***power ups***. A white/red Mushroom will make him big. If Mario is big and *if he touches an enemy he gets smaller; he will not die*.
> 
> If Mario is big and he hits a question block that has a power-up, a fire-flower will come out. The fire flower will give him the power to throw fire balls, which can defeat enemies. *If he gets hit as Fire Mario*, he will go back to being *small Mario*.
